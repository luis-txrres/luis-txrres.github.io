## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 5

I liked this lab because it’s cool how we can design a program that basically says when we can and can’t park at certain times of different days. I never really thought that you could write a program that does this since we usually just try to interpret it with our own heads. However, being able to write code that executes a program that is able to tell us if we’re able to park a lot helps a lot in a scenario like that. 

* Lab 6

Lab 6 was probably my favorite lab yet kind of difficult. I really liked the idea of being able to input cards into the computer and determining if it was a winning hand or a losing hand. I don’t usually play BlackJack since I’m more into Poker but it’s still the same idea. Like all the other labs, I find it so interesting and cool how we can make programs that builds stuff like this. 

* Lab 10

I enjoyed this lab as a whole because it allowed us to get input from a file that we could use in our code to return a result to the user. I think it’s interesting how we can get this information and input it into our program and pretty much do whatever we want with it. I also just liked the idea of getting demographics, population size, etc. about different counties in the state.
